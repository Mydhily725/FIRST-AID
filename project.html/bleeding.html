      <h2>What is Bleeding?</h2>
      <p>Bleeding, also referred to as hemorrhage, is the loss of blood from the circulatory system. It can occur internally, when blood escapes from blood vessels within the body, or externally, when blood leaks out through a break in the skin or mucous membranes. Bleeding is a critical condition, as it can lead to significant health complications if not managed promptly. The severity of bleeding is influenced by factors such as the location of the injury, the amount of blood lost, and the individual’s overall health.</p>

      <h3>Types of Bleeding</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Arterial Bleeding:</b></li>
          <P>This is bleeding from an artery. It’s characterized by bright red blood that spurts out in rhythmic pulses, matching the heartbeat. This type of bleeding is often severe and requires immediate medical attention because arteries carry blood under high pressure.</P>
        <br>
        <li><b>Venous Bleeding:</b></li> 
          <p>Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels in the body. Bleeding from capillaries is typically slow and steady and usually appears as oozing from the wound. This type of bleeding is usually less severe and can often be controlled with direct pressure.</p>
