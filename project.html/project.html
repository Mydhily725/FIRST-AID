        <h2>What is First-Aid?</h2>
        <p>
          First aid is the immediate care you provide to someone who’s injured

          maneuver. Your quick actions can stabilise a person’s condition until
          professional help arrives, making a real difference in emergencies.
          Knowing first aid isn’t just helpful; it builds confidence and fosters
          a culture of safety in your community. By learning first aid, you
          prepare yourself for potential crises. There’s much more to explore
          about essential techniques and resources that can enhance your first
          aid skills

        <h2>Basic Principles of Fist-Aid</h2>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li><b>Preserving Life</b></li>
          <p>
            Preserving life is the first and most important part of the 3 Ps of
            first aid, critical for saving lives. In an emergency, the main goal
            is to keep the injured or ill person alive until medical help
            arrives. This principle highlights the importance of dealing with
            life-threatening conditions straight away, like heavy bleeding,
            difficulty breathing, or heart attacks.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li><b>Prevent Deterioration</b></li>
          <p>
            Once you’ve followed all the steps associated with the first
            principle, your next priority is to prevent deterioration of the
            injured person’s condition. Keeping a casualty still to avoid
            aggravating their injury, or from complicating any unseen issues, is
            crucial. This helps prevent to further injuries, and clearing the
            area of any immediate dangers will help you to do so.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li><b>Promote Recovery</b></li>
          <p>
            After you've provided the best first aid care possible, it's time to
            encourage recovery. This can be accomplished by boosting
            self-esteem, offering solace, striving to ease pain, and other
            methods. Depending on your particular circumstance, these first aid
            and emergency tips and methods may change. However, keeping in mind
            the fundamentals of what to do could save a life or spare you from
            more suffering. Before you find yourself in a scenario where it's
            difficult to think properly, be aware of these straightforward
            procedures.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li><b>Taking Immediate Action</b></li>
          <p>
            When it comes to administering first aid, time is of the essence.
            Immediate action can make the difference between life and death,
            between a full recovery and lasting harm
          </p>
          <br />
          <li><b>Calming the Situation</b></li>
          <p>
            Panic can cause overwhelmed workers to freeze when a safety incident
            occurs. Deep, structured breathing can help them calm down and get
            ready to respond. But even when you’re prepared for a safety
            incident, panic can still arise. This fight-flight-or-freeze
            response can overwhelm your workers on site, making it difficult to
            focus and impairing their judgment.Overcoming this response and
            remaining calm is essential to executing your EAP effectively.
            Responders on utility sites can start by regaining control over
            their emotions, communicating clearly.

            the difference between life and death in an emergency. The goal of
